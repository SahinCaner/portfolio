          <p>
            In 2016, me and my partner were looking for a project to boost our
            future projects and that is how we decided to buy
            <strong> Saglik ve Yasam</strong>.

            <h1>WHAT IS SAGLIK VE YASAM?</h1>
            <p>
              An online health and well-being information source for everyone
              who needs healing or who wants to have a healtier life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Saglik ve Yasam had content partnership in and out of Turkey with
              so many health organisations and content creators such as Mayo
              Clinic and Greatist.
            </p>

            <p>
              Even though, Saglik ve Yasam had so many quality, proven and
              trusted content it was not a successful project. It did not have
              enough organic traffic and most of the users were coming from
              social media sites through advertisements. And even with
              advertisements it could only attract a shy of average
              <strong> 2000 people </strong> daily (depends on a budget, higher
              advertisement budget means, higher traffic). However, it is a very
              low number for its content.

            <h3>KEY MOTIVATION & GOAL</h3>

            <p>
              In 2016, me and my ex-partner were brain storming about a booster
              project. We needed a project that can attract high volumes from
              Google searches inorder to launch and boost our new projects
              without spending any money on advertisements. That was our key
              motivation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Meanwhile, old firm that I was working for decided to sell Saglik
              ve Yasam and its content rights. It was a perfect project for our
              motivation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our keygoal was to establish a new strategy and redesign inorder
              to achive more users and create a trusted online healthcare
              information source in Turkey.
            </p>

            <h3>MY ROLE & RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
            <p>
              I led the design and front-end development of Saglik ve Yasam and
              I worked alone during this process. It took 8 weeks to complete
              the design and development.

            <h4>KICKOFF</h4>
            <h1>PROCESS</h1>
            <p>
              There were already so many good articles and information in
              Saglikveyasam.com and we had no idea why users was not spending
              any time on the website.
            </p>
            <p>
              To understand why onboarded user's bounce rate were so high (80%),
              we set up Crazyeggâ€™s heat map and collected our users behaviour
              data for a month.
            </p>

            <p>
              The data we collected from Crazyegg made me realize, almost no one
              was clicking the side related articles. That made me think, maybe
              I should remove those articles and let users focus on the article
              itself instead of distracting them early on the page.
            </p>

              caption="Side related articles can be seen under &quot;Videolar&quot; section."
            />

            <p>
              With the old design of Saglik ve Yasam, most of the users also
              were not clicking to the related articles at the end of pages.
              They were clearly losing interest after they read the articles.
            </p>

              alt="saglik ve yasam old related articles component"
              caption="Old design of the related articles at the end of the page. Maybe
                the titles were not readable enough? Or too generic? Okay I
                needed to solve this problem."
            />

            <p>
              Problem with the old related article design, it was not readable
              enough and they looked like advertisements rather than interesting
              article titles and images.
            </p>

            <p>
              To solve this problem I wanted to design something unusual, unique
              and bold. I wanted to create a fun experience for readers rather
              than boring encyclopedia like or regular CMS like website reading
              experience.
            </p>

            <p>
              With the rise of the smart phone usage in the world, I had to
              redesign the website with mobile-first mindset. And I started to
              redesign process by designing single Article Card Component.

                  caption="Skecth of the article page. Article Cards can be seen at the

                />
              </div>
            </div>

            <p>
              New design of the Article Card Component, helped me to reuse it
              anywhere I want in the website. So I also decided to use it on
              home page too.
            </p>

                Card Components in the home page."
            />

            <p>
              I redesigned every page with the new design language. I used
              bigger fonts, bigger images, more white spaces all over the
              website to be more consistent. With the usage of more white space,
              redesigned Saglik ve Yasam looked more modern, fresh and easy to
              read and scan.
